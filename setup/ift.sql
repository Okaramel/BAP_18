This initiative carries ecological implications, such as mitigating the carbon footprint in the implementation area through algae\'s CO2 absorption, repurposing neglected everyday items, and fostering ecological awareness among those encountering this object in their daily routines. Additionally, the project holds aesthetic and functional significance by discreetly incorporating algae into a common object, reducing intrusiveness in the urban environment, and enhancing the appeal and harmony of everyday objects with their surroundings. An algae incubator is defined as a device creating optimal conditions for algae growth and development, encompassing components like nutrients, a lighting system, temperature regulation, and other environmental factors to facilitate photosynthesis and algae multiplication. Algae, as photosynthetic organisms, serve various purposes, including biomass production, CO2 capture, oxygen generation, and other potential applications. In ongoing initiatives, LIQUID3 stands out as an urban photo-bioreactor harnessing microalgae\'s power to efficiently eliminate CO2 while producing O2 and biomass [^1]. Additionally, efforts involve the development of a sealed panel to prevent contaminations/evaporations and enhance biomass concentration, as detailed in the study by Bajwa and Bishnoi in 2021 [^2]. Inspired by the idea of giving new life to overlooked everyday objects, the project transforms discarded signs into innovative algae cultivation systems.', 'Materials The project utilizes a diverse array of objects and tools to create an efficient algae cultivation system. The materials used in the incubator can be divided into two main categories : Structural Materials Acrylic glass Glue Silicon Nuts Functional Materials Led strip Air pump Arduino uno Wires 220V-5V power adaptater Power strip', 'The emergency exit sign is made of 5mm thick acrylic and was cut using a laser cutting machine. The Fig. 2 is a cross-section of the incubator with dimensions. We made a plexiglass box with an initial internal volume ùëâ = ùêøùë•ùëôùë• ‚Ñé = 240 ùë• 110 ùë• 10 mm = 264,000 mm3 = 264 ml. The man, arrow, and door were glued inside this box. The water and algae therefore circulate around these shapes. The box was then closed with a cover also made of acrylic, machined with several holes to attach the incubator to the ceiling, insert the air pump pipe, and allow air to escape, as can be seen in Fig. 3. Once the incubator was closed, silicone was added to ensure the system\'s watertightness. We then added a LED strip to allow the algae to grow. This RGB addressable LED strip is controlled by an Arduino board. The transparent acrylic case of the incubator allows light to reach the algae. Finally, an air pump is integrated into the system and the air is directly sent into the incubator through a pipe. This also creates a current in the incubator, which is favorable to algae growth.', 'The overall design of the incubator is aesthetically pleasing and attention-grabbing, raising awareness of both algae cultivation and the potential for sustainable innovation. However, there are still some areas where the project could be improved. Four potential improvements are discussed below Light diffuser : A light diffuser would help to distribute light more evenly throughout the incubator, which would be beneficial for algae growth. Temperature control : A temperature sensor and heater would help to maintain the water temperature in an optimal range for algae growth. Nutrient level control : A nutrient sensor would help to ensure that the algae have the nutrients they need to grow. Harvesting mechanism : A harvesting mechanism would make it easier to collect the algae once the incubator is full. These improvements would make the algae incubator project more efficient, more user-friendly and guarantee optimal algae growth.', 'An algae incubator is a controlled environment that provides the optimal conditions for algae growth, including temperature, light, and nutrient supply. Algae are unicellular aquatic organisms that can grow rapidly and are relatively easy to cultivate. They have the potential to be used for a variety of purposes, including food, feed, biofuel, and bioplastics. Our project integrates an algae incubator into an emergency exit sign, transforming an often overlooked object into a sustainable and multifunctional element. By combining an emergency exit sign with an algae incubator, we demonstrate a novel approach to enhancing the functionality and sustainability of everyday objects. The algae can be harvested for various applications, while the sign serves its primary purpose as a visual aid in emergency situations. The overall design is visually appealing and attention-grabbing, raising awareness of both algae cultivation and the potential for sustainable innovation.', 'uploads/images/1734379148721-xxm6o2upfreacw5jqtsmb0v006s367.png', 'uploads/images/1734379148715-nkfd92iz1a85n6uwcwfmun0zoc57or.jpg', 'uploads/images/1734379148718-hr2d4n9clms1jwmq7me0gr6cqiw147.png', 'uploads/images/1734379148704-oru38c7nd534b072x1gk4pqaib8gb3.png', '\"Reconnect with food production through indoor , modulable , adjustable, educational aquaponic production', 'CONTEXT', 'SYSTEM OPERATION', 'Manufacturing', 'DISCUSSIONS', 'Exit Panel Algae Incubator'),

Today, prostheses vary from 3,900 euros for a simple joint to 11,000 euros for a myoelectric one [^1]; not everyone can afford this type of prosthesis. The field of prostheses is vast and diversified, with mechanical, myoelectric, hydraulic, or aesthetic prostheses[^2][^3][^4]. The prostheses integrating a control system by nerve connection or tactile perception are complex and expensive. The solution is an inexpensive kit for forearm amputees, allowing them to feel shapes and textures or fingertip pressure using haptics. Haptics is a scientific field that focuses on the sense of touch. It can be divided into two primary areas: kinesthetic haptics and vibrotactile haptics. Haptics transmits different sensations through various methods, such as vibrations, pressure changes, or other physical sensations[^5][^6][^7][^8][^9][^10][^11][^12].

Carbon fiber is lighter and stiffer than glass fiber whereas glass fiber has elastic properties when deformed under stress. In the boardsport industry, these fibers are used in addition to core materials and resin to make strong and resilient composite boards. Fibers are used as a way to control a board\'s flexibility and resistance to daily use. However, there are many environmental drawbacks to using petroleum-fiber composites as they are not recyclable, and their fabrication request a lot of energy. Indeed, their high carbon footprint questions their promise to be tomorrow\'s material for reinforcements and opens a new direction of research toward finding environmentally friendly alternatives for these materials. Natural fibers like flax fiber also have excellent mechanical properties. Their affordable price and low carbon footprint highlight them as a competitive alternative to petroleum-based fibers [^1][^2]. The purpose of this innovation project is to test the applicability of replacing petroleum-based fibers with natural fibers in the making of boards for riding sports.\r\n\r\n', 'Riding sports communities are close to the environment because their sports often involve natural phenomena. Indeed, a lot of brands with a riding identity communicate about their ways to respect the environment.

Moreover, this trend moves board sports companies toward bio-sourced and eco-friendly materials, leading some brands to sometimes use natural fibers instead of petroleum fiber in the making of boards. For example, Airush Kiteboarding designed and produced the Apex Eco, a kitesurf board using basalt fiber as a reinforcement [^3]. Overall, the use of flax and basalt fibers in the making of boards is still a relatively new field of research, and there is a need for more extensive testing to fully understand their potential and limitations.
